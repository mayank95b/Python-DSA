    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python lists act as dynamic arrays and support a number of common operations through methods called on them. The two most common operations performed on a list are indexing and assigning to an index position. These operations are both designed to be run in constant time, O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine you wanted to test different methods to construct a list that is [0,1,2...10000]. Let go ahead and compare various methods, such as appending to the end of a list, concatenating a list, or using tools such as casting and list comprehension.\n",
